            <h1 class="heading">What Are Hydroponic Systems and How Do They Work?</h1>
        </section>
        <img src="./Media/Hydroponics_5.jpg">
        <p class="pag">Hydroponics is the art of gardening without soil. Hydroponics is a Latin word meaning “working
            water.” In the
            absence of soil, water goes to work providing nutrients, hydration, and oxygen to plant life. From
            watermelons to jalapeños to orchids, plants flourish under the careful regimen of hydroponics. Using minimal
            space, 90% less water than traditional agriculture, and ingenious design, hydroponic gardens grow beautiful
            fruits and flowers in half the time.
        </p>
        <p class="pag">
            Though the technology sounds cutting-edge, the history of hydroponics dates back to the famed Hanging
            Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The Euphrates River was diverted into
            channels that cascaded down the lavish garden walls. In the 13th century, Marco Polo wrote of witnessing
            floating gardens in China. However, hydroponics is far from merely an innovation of the ancient ages. In the
            1990s, NASA grew aeroponic bean seedlings in zero gravity aboard a space station, opening up the possibility
            of sustainable agriculture in space. Hydroponics continues to be a timeless and dynamic method of water
            conservation and crop production. </p>

        <h2 class="heading2">What is hydroponics?</h2>
        <p class="pag">Hydroponics is the cultivation of plants without using soil. Hydroponic flowers, herbs, and
            vegetables are
            planted in inert growing media and supplied with nutrient-rich solutions, oxygen, and water. This system
            fosters rapid growth, stronger yields, and superior quality. When a plant is grown in soil, its roots are
            perpetually searching for the necessary nutrition to support the plant. If a plant’s root system is exposed
            directly to water and nutrition, the plant does not have to exert any energy in sustaining itself. The
            energy the roots would have expended acquiring food and water can be redirected into the plant’s maturation.
            As a result, leaf growth flourishes as does the blooming of fruits and flowers. </p>
        <p class="pag">
            Plants sustain themselves by a process called photosynthesis. Plants capture sunlight with chlorophyll (a
            green pigment present in their leaves). They use the light’s energy to split water molecules they’ve
            absorbed via their root system. The hydrogen molecules combine with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates,
            which plants use to nourish themselves. Oxygen is then released into the atmosphere, a crucial factor in
            preserving our planet's habitability. Plants do not need soil to photosynthesize. They need the soil to
            supply them with water and nutrients. When nutrients are dissolved in water they can be applied directly to
            the plant’s root system by flooding, misting, or immersion. Hydroponic innovations have proven direct
            exposure to nutrient-filled water can be a more effective and versatile method of growth than traditional
            irrigation.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading2">
            How does hydroponics work?
        </h2>
        <p class="pag">
            Hydroponic systems work by allowing minute control over environmental conditions like temperature and pH
            balance and maximized exposure to nutrients and water. Hydroponics operates under a very simple principle:
            provide plants exactly what they need when they need it. Hydroponics administer nutrient solutions tailored
            to the needs of the particular plant being grown. They allow you to control exactly how much light the
            plants receive and for how long. pH levels can be monitored and adjusted. In a highly customized and
            controlled environment, plant growth accelerates.
        </p>
        <p class="pag">
            By controlling the environment of the plant, many risk factors are reduced. Plants grown in gardens and
            fields are introduced to a host of variables that negatively impact their health and growth. Fungus in the
            soil can spread diseases to plants. Wildlife like rabbits can plunder ripening vegetables from your garden.
            Pests like locusts can descend on crops and obliterate them in an afternoon. Hydroponic systems end the
            unpredictability of growing plants outdoors and in the earth. Without the mechanical resistance of the soil,
            seedlings can mature much faster. By eliminating pesticides, hydroponics produce much healthier and
            high-quality fruits and vegetables. Without obstacles, plants are free to grow vigorously and rapidly.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What are the components of a hydroponic system?
        </h2>
        <p>To maintain a flourishing hydroponic system, you will need to become acquainted with a few components that
            make hydroponics run efficiently. </p>
        <h3>Growing media</h3>
        <p>Hydroponic plants are often grown in inert media that support the plant’s weight and anchor its root
            structure. Growing media is the substitute for soil, however, it does not provide any independent nutrition
            to the plant. Instead, this porous media retains moisture and nutrients from the nutrient solution which it
            then delivers to the plant. Many growing media are also pH-neutral, so they will not upset the balance of
            your nutrient solution. There are a host of different media to choose from, and the specific plant and
            hydroponic system will dictate which media best suits your endeavor. Hydroponic growing media is widely
            available both online and at local nurseries and gardening stores. </p>
        <h3>Air stones and air pumps </h3>
        <p>Plants that are submerged in water can quickly drown if the water is not sufficiently aerated. Air stones
            disperse tiny bubbles of dissolved oxygen throughout your nutrient solution reservoir. These bubbles also
            help evenly distribute the dissolved nutrients in the solution. Air stones do not generate oxygen on their
            own. They need to be attached to an external air pump via opaque food grade plastic tubing (the opacity will
            prevent algae growth from setting in). Air stones and air pumps are popular aquarium components and can be
            purchased easily at pet stores.
        </p>
        <h3>Net pots </h3>
        <p>
            Net pots are mesh planters that hold hydroponic plants. The latticed material allows roots to grow out of
            the sides and bottom of the pot, giving greater exposure to oxygen and nutrients. Net pots also provide
            superior drainage compared to traditional clay or plastic pots.
        </p>
        <img src="./Media/hydroponics_3.jpg">
        <h2>What are the six types of hydroponic systems?

        </h2>
        <p>There are hundreds of hydroponic methods, but all of them are a modification or combination of six basic
            hydroponic systems.</p>
        <h3>1. Deep water culture systems </h3>
        <p>Deep water culture hydroponics are simply plants suspended in aerated water. Deep water culture systems, also
            known as a DWC system, are one of the easiest and most popular methods of hydroponics on the market. A DWC
            system dangles net pots holding plants over a deep reservoir of oxygen-rich nutrient solution. The plant’s
            roots are submerged in the solution, providing it with perpetual access to nutrition, water, and oxygen.
            Deep water culture is considered by some to be the purest form of hydroponics.</p>
        <p>Since the root system is suspended in water at all times, proper water oxygenation is vital to the plant’s
            survival. If there is not enough oxygen supplied to the plant’s roots, the plant will drown in the solution.
            Add an air stone connected to an air pump at the bottom of the reservoir to supply oxygenation to the entire
            system. The bubbles from the air stone will also help circulate the nutrient solution. </p>
        <p>It is very easy to assemble a deep water culture system at home or in a classroom without needing expensive
            hydroponics equipment. You can use a clean bucket or old aquarium to hold the solution and place a floating
            surface like styrofoam on top to house the net pots. Plants in DWC systems should only have their roots
            submerged in the solution. No part of the stem or vegetation should be underwater. You can even leave about
            an inch and a half of the roots above the waterline. The air stone bubbles will pop out of the surface and
            splash onto the exposed roots, so they will not be at risk of drying out. </p>
        <h3>2. Wick systems </h3>
        <p>
            In a wick system, plants are nestled in growing media on a tray that sits on top of a reservoir. This
            reservoir houses a water solution with dissolved nutrients. Wicks travel from the reservoir to the growing
            tray. Water and nutrients flow up the wick and saturate the growing media around the root systems of the
            plants. These wicks can be made of material as simple as rope, string, or felt. Wick systems are by far the
            most simple form of hydroponics. Wick systems are passive hydroponics - meaning they don’t require
            mechanical parts like pumps to function. This makes it ideal for situations where electricity is either
            unreliable or unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wicks systems work by a process called capillary action. The wick absorbs the water it’s immersed in like a
            sponge, and when it comes in contact with the porous growing media, it transfers the nutrient solution. Wick
            system hydroponics only work if accompanied by growing media that is able to facilitate nutrient and water
            transference. Coco coir (fibers from the outer husks of coconuts) have excellent moisture retention and the
            added benefit of being pH neutral. Perlite is also pH neutral and extremely porous, making it ideal for
            wicking systems. Vermiculite is also very porous, and also possesses a high cation-exchange capacity. This
            means it can store nutrients for later use. These three growing media are the most suitable for hydroponic
            wick systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wick systems work quite slowly compared to other hydroponic systems, which does limit what is practical to
            grow with them. You’ll want to make sure for every plant in the growing tray you have at least one wick
            running from the reservoir. These wicks should be placed close to the root system of the plant. Though
            capable of functioning with aeration, many people do choose to add an air stone and air pump to the wick
            system’s reservoir. This adds extra oxygenation to the hydroponic system.

        <h4>
            3. Nutrient film technique systems
        </h4>
        <p>
            Nutrient film technique (NFT) systems suspend plants above a stream of continuously flowing nutrient
            solution
            that washes over the ends of the plant’s root systems. The channels holding the plants are tilted, allowing
            water to run down the length of the grow tray before draining into the reservoir below. The water in the
            reservoir is then aerated via air stone. A submersible pump then pumps the nutrient-rich water out of the
            reservoir and back to the top of the channel. The nutrient film technique is a recirculating hydroponic
            system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike with deep water culture hydroponics, the roots of the plants in an NFT system are not immersed in
            water.
            Instead, the stream (or “film”) only flows over the ends of their roots. The roots’ tips will wick the
            moisture
            up into the plant, while the exposed root system is given plenty of access to oxygen. The bottoms of the
            channels are grooved, so the shallow film can pass over the root tips with ease. This also prevents water
            from
            pooling or damming up against the root systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though nutrient film technique systems are constantly recycling water, it is wise to drain the
            reservoir
            and replenish the nutrient solution every week or so. This ensures your plants are being delivered ample
            nutrition. NFT channels must be angled at a gradual slope. If it’s too steep, the water will rush down the
            channel without properly nourishing the plants. If too much water is being pumped through the channel, the
            system will overflow and the plants can drown. NFT hydroponics are popular commercial systems, as they can
            support several plants per channel and can easily be mass-produced. Nutrient film technique systems are best
            suited for lightweight plants, like mustard greens, kale, lettuce, spinach as well as fruits like
            strawberries.
            Heavier fruiting plants like tomatoes and cucumbers will require trellises to support the excess weight.
        </p>
        <h4>
            4. Ebb and flow systems</h4>
        <p>
            Ebb and flow hydroponics work by flooding a grow bed with a nutrient solution from a reservoir below. The
            submersible pump in the reservoir is equipped with a timer. When the timer starts, the pump fills the grow
            bed
            with the water and nutrients. When the timer stops, gravity slowly drains the water out of the grow bed and
            flushes it back into the reservoir. The system is equipped with an overflow tube to ensure flooding doesn’t
            surpass a certain level and damage the stalks and fruits of the plants. Unlike the previous systems
            mentioned,
            the plants in an ebb and flow system are not constantly exposed to water. While the grow bed is flooded, the
            plants drink up the nutrient solution through their root systems. When the water ebbs and the grow bed
            empties,
            the roots dry out. The dry roots then oxygenate in the interval before the next flood. The length of time
            between floods is dictated by the size of your grow bed and the size of your plants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ebb and flow systems (also called flood and drain systems) are one of the most popular hydroponic growing
            methods. The abundance of oxygen and nutrition the plants are supplied with encourages quick and vigorous
            growth. The ebb and flow system is easily customizable and versatile. The grow bed can be filled with an
            assortment of net pots and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Perhaps more than any other hydroponic
            system,
            the ebb and flow system allows you to experiment with your plants and media.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ebb and flow systems can accommodate almost any type of vegetation. Your primary limitation is the size and
            depth of your grow tray. Root vegetables will require a much deeper bed than lettuce or strawberries.
            Tomatoes,
            peas, beans, cucumbers, carrots, and peppers are all popular ebb and flow crops. In fact, you can even
            attach
            trellises directly to the grow bed. “Grow rocks” and expanded clay pebbles (hydroton) are some of the most
            popular growing media in ebb and flow hydroponics. These are cleanable and reusable, lightweight, and while
            they
            do retain moisture they will also drain. This is an important quality in ebb and flow systems.
        </p>
        <img src="./Media/hydro_2.jpg">
        <h4>
            5. Drip systems</h4>
        <p>
            In a hydroponic drip system, the aerated and nutrient-rich reservoir pumps solution through a network of
            tubes
            to individual plants. This solution is dripped slowly into the growing media surrounding the root system,
            keeping the plants moist and well-nourished. Drip systems are the most popular and widespread method of
            hydroponics, especially among commercial growers. Drip systems can be individual plants or massive
            irrigation
            operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two configurations of drip system hydroponics: recovery and non-recovery. In recovery systems,
            more
            popular with smaller, at-home growers, the excess water is drained from the grow bed back into the reservoir
            to
            be recirculated during the next drip cycle. In non-recovery systems, the excess water drains out of the
            growing
            media and runs to waste. This method is more popular among commercial growers. Though non-recovery drip
            systems
            can sound wasteful, large-scale growers are very conservative with water usage. These drip systems are
            designed
            only to deliver precisely the amount of solution required to keep the growing media around the plant
            dampened.
            Non-recovery drip systems employ elaborate timers and feeding schedules to keep waste to a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are growing plants in a recovery drip system, you will need to be attuned to the fluctuations in the
            pH
            of the nutrient solution. This is true of any system where wastewater re-circulates into the reservoir.
            Plants
            will deplete the nutrient content of the solution as well as alter the pH balance, so the grower will need
            to
            monitor and adjust the solution reservoir more than they would need to in a non-recovery system. Growing
            media
            can also become oversaturated with nutrients, so they will need to be washed and replaced periodically.
        </p>
        <img src="./Media/Hydroponics_4.jpg">
        <h4>
            6. Aeroponics</h4>
        <p>
            Aeroponics systems suspend plants in the air and expose the naked roots to a nutrient-filled mist.
            Aeroponics
            systems are enclosed frameworks, like cubes or towers, that can hold a multitude of plants at once. Water
            and
            nutrients are stored in a reservoir, and then pumped to a nozzle that atomizes the solution and distributes
            it
            as a fine mist. The mist is usually released from the top of the tower, allowing it to cascade down the
            chamber.
            Some aeroponics continuously mist the plant’s roots, much like NFT systems expose the roots to the nutrient
            film
            at all times. Others function more like the ebb and flow system, spraying the roots with mist in intervals.
            Aeroponics do not need substrate media to survive. The root’s constant exposure to air allows them to drink
            in
            oxygen and grow at an accelerated rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aeroponics systems use less water than any other form of hydroponics. In fact, it takes 95% less water to
            grow a
            crop aeroponically than in an irrigated field. Their vertical structure is designed to take up minimal room
            and
            allows for numerous towers to be housed in a single location. With aeroponics, great yields can be produced
            even
            in confined spaces. Furthermore, because of their maximized exposure to oxygen, aeroponic plants grow faster
            than other hydroponically grown plants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aeroponics allow for simple harvesting year-round. Vine plants and nightshades like tomatoes, bell peppers,
            and
            eggplants all perform well in an aeroponic environment. Lettuce, baby greens, herbs, watermelons,
            strawberries,
            and ginger all also flourish. However, fruiting trees are too large and heavy to be grown aeroponically, and
            underground plants with extensive root systems like carrots and potatoes cannot be grown.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Reverse osmosis and hydroponics
        </h2>
        <p>
            The invigorating powers of water are at the very core of hydroponics. Water bathes your hydroponic garden in
            nutrients, vitalizing them and promoting their vibrant growth. If you are truly invested in the health of
            your
            plants, you should equally care about the purity of the water sustaining them. Unfortunately, most water is

            of contaminants. Municipal water suppliers disinfect water reservoirs with chlorine. According to the U.S.
            Geological Survey, 85% of the water in the United States is hard water (meaning it contains elevated levels
            of
            calcium and magnesium). Industrial spills, agricultural runoff, and waste in landfills can leach chemicals
            and
            VOCs into the groundwater supply

            Reverse osmosis, (also called RO), eliminates 98% of all impurities from water by forcing it through a
            semipermeable membrane. Reverse osmosis strips water of heavy metals, salts, bacteria, and total dissolved
            solids (TDS). The result is water of remarkable purity. Using RO water for hydroponics ensures that your
            plants
            are drinking up only the nutrients you want them too. The vast majority of commercial hydroponic operations
            use
            RO water to sustain their crops. Much like hydroponics proves there is a superior way to grow plants,
            reverse
            osmosis has proven there is a superior way to facilitate this growth.

        <h3>
            Why should I use RO water for hydroponics?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Reverse osmosis water allows you to start with a blank slate and add precise levels of nutrients, promoters,
            and
            pH adjusters to your water. From this neutral base you can construct the ideal nutrient solution. For
            example,
            if you live in an area with hard water, your water will already contain high levels of calcium. Many
            hydroponic
            nutrient blends contain calcium, as it does encourage plant growth. However, adding a calcium-rich solution
            to
            hard water will result in nutrient imbalance. It is also much harder to measure nutrient levels in water
            with
            high levels of TDS. Most manufacturer's instructions for nutrient solutions are based on RO water. So, if
            you
            are trying to bring the water to 800ppm of nutrients, and the water already exists at 200ppm of TDS, you
            will
            have to approximate. The results will inevitably be inaccurate. Reverse osmosis water is also lower in pH.
            Plants prefer acidic water, and using RO water to hydrate your crops will lessen the amount of pH regulation
            incumbent on you as a grower.

        <p>
            Controlling the nutrient balance and pH level of your water is an integral component to your hydroponics’
            success. If your plants are not receiving proper nutrition, it doesn’t matter how well your hydroponics
            system
            is running. A reverse osmosis system ensures that your plants are only absorbing proper nutrients dissolved
            in
            water of the highest purity.
